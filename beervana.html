<p>If you know PaperKite, then you probably know we love building Apps. Solving real-world problems with native mobile experiences is one of the things that truly makes us happy. Another one of those things is Beer (and cider!). So when the Beervana team came to us to get help with a new App for their Beer festival, the choice was simple.

We started by hosting an evening PK IGNITE workshop with the Beervana team.  This helped us to identify their primary outcomes, and discover the features that would have the greatest benefit to festival attendees. With the additions of pizza and beer the workshop was easy. And the number one goal? To build a new product that reflected the Beervana brand and helped drive engagement prior to, and during, the event. This was going to be exciting!
